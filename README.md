## run_gmhmm.pl usage
before using:
this script should run under the path where the asseblied genomes are.

`prompt> perl run_gmhmm.pl list.txt`

*list.txt is a intermediate file which you can rename it whatever you want. It will contain a list of all the names of asseblied genomes under this path.*
